# English project

This is my 2023 English Final, it is made out of AI generated images, a simple program, and 210 lines of handwritten code. The scene in The Queen's Gambit represents Elizabeth Harmon's Chess Final Championship, where she plays against Vasily Borgov for the World's Best title.

## How to run the presentation

Click on [this link](https://kendanguest.github.io/english-project/) and click anywhere to navigate from scene to scene.

## How I created this

This was made using the p5 game engine in Microsoft VSCode. Every coordinate and every movement was handcoded by me. The coding file is named "sketch.js".

## How I sourced the images

The images were made using the 2.0 Realistic Vision image generating software found [here](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/), and were made by hand written prompts.

## Ideas on how this could expand further

Somewhere deep within the source code, there is a function on when an image or a sprite is clicked, it will do something different. Expanding further, you could create websites, games, and maybe some other things, but I decided on a presentation due to the time crunch and the lack of complexity.

## How it relates to my passion

I've always been into coding, videogames, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and even a bit of digital art at times. I figured this project would be great for me because it combines a lot of my interests into a single presentation, and that's what I like about it.
